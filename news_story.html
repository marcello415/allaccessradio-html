                          <td width="576"> The friend of Eminem who helped The Source corroborate its claim that Eminem
                            is a racist has written a letter to the magazine saying he was taken out of context and that
                            he believes Marshall Mathers is not a racist. <br><br>The letter was written by Chaos Kid to
                            Kim Osorio, the editor-in-chief of The Source, and was found posted on various online
                            newsgroups. <br><br>Chaos Kid, a Detroit MC who is featured in The Source's February cover
                            story, was Eminem's writing partner between 1988 and 1993 . He is also described as one of
                            the kids in a rap crew called Bassmint Productions to which Eminem belonged when he recorded
                            a pair of controversial freestyles, which surfaced in November and found Eminem using
                            offensive language toward black people. Though Chaos Kid says in the magazine that he opted
                            out of the freestyle sessions, his interview is used to validate the magazine's contention
                            that Eminem is a racist. <br><br>In his letter, Chaos Kid says his words were manipulated
                            and facts contorted to fit The Source's motives. He writes to Osorio, "I am forced at this
                            point to recognize that there are obviously some ulterior motives/personal
                            hang-ups/political/racial agendas going on behind the scenes at The Source and this is
                            making it impossible for you to present the issue of these tapes in a true light that would
                            give a full spectrum of perspective." <br><br>Chaos explains that the freestyles were called
                            "Suckerin' Rhymes," and that they were intentionally misguided. He says their purpose was to
                            be as "goofy/stupid/ignorant/wack as possible." He accuses The Source of making some factual
                            errors in its reporting and failing to give his quotes proper context. <br><br>He writes of
                            his personal experiences with Eminem during that time and says that the famous rapper never
                            used the N-word or "any other derogatory names or made any derogatory remarks about
                            African-Americans in casual conversation with me. In fact, we personally had conversations
                            talking about how we hated racism and racists and both had real songs denouncing racism!!"
                            <br><br>Chaos Kid concludes by writing that, in his opinion, "Marshall Mathers is not a
                            racist. Although the songs were in bad taste, they were not intended to be taken seriously
                            or even heard and do not represent the true sentiments of Eminem." <br><br>Though Chaos
                            Kid's words seem to support the generally accepted notion that Eminem's freestyles weren't
                            pathological or even characteristic, they differ from the sentiments expressed in Eminem's
                            own apology issued in December . In a statement, Em said the offensive freestyles were
                            motivated by a relationship with a girl gone awry and that they were written from a hurt,
                            emotional and reactionary point of view. <br><br>Chaos Kid's letter asks for Osorio to
                            publish a "Letter to the Editor" in the next issue of The Source to clarify his position or,
                            he says, he'll be forced to tell "the truth" to other media outlets. Though the letter was
                            addressed to Osorio, when reached for comment, the editor said she had no knowledge of
                            receiving such a letter. <br><br>This report is written by Joseph Patel and provided by MTV
